## Caravan tax calculator for Germany

For the purposes of calculating vehicle tax, caravans are considered to be [trailers](https://kfz-steuer.wiki/en/trailer-tax-germany/). Thus, as with other trailers, the calculation is based on the permissible total weight.

**Info:** Caravan vs. motorhome
Caravans are considered as trailers in the motor vehicle tax law sense and are taxed accordingly according to weight. Unlike [motorhomes](https://kfz-steuer.wiki/en/camper-tax-germany/) , they do not have their own drive and therefore do not emit any pollutant emissions. The calculation of the motor vehicle tax for motorhomes depends on the respective pollutant class.

## How is the tax for caravans calculated?

Following the calculation of the tax for trailers, the caravan tax is calculated at **7.46 €** per 200 kg weight or part thereof, and the amount is rounded down to exact euros. However, the maximum amount of the trailer tax is **373 €** as long as the total weight of the caravan is less than 10 tons. Heavier trailer combinations require a towing vehicle approved for this purpose and receive a higher trailer surcharge.

## Can caravans be exempted from tax?

If a caravan is permanently on private property and is not driven on public roads, it is exempt from motor vehicle tax. It is not possible to be exempted and to obtain a green license plate number, as is the case for some other trailers, but the vehicle tax can be reduced by other means: Since for many people the use of the caravan is highly dependent on the weather, a seasonal license plate, by which the caravan is only registered in a specified period, is a good way to reduce the annual tax for caravans.
