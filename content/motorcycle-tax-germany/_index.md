## German motorcycle tax calculator for Germany

The car tax for motorcycles is only dependent on the respective cubic capacity (cm³ / ccm). Our easy-to-use calculator can help you determine your motorcycle tax immediately. Motorcycling is taxed comparatively low in Germany. For some two-wheelers the taxes are waived completely. In addition, motorcyclists with a seasonal license plate can save taxes and insurance.

## Types of motorcycle tax in Germany

Motorcycle tax differs between the categories of motorcycles and “light motorcycles” (Leichtkrafträder), which are motorcycles with a maximum rated output of 11 kW and cubic capacity between 50 cm³ and 125 cm³. The classification of a two-wheeled vehicle can be seen in the vehicle registration document - the registration certificate part I (Zulassungsbescheinigung Teil I). There the cubic capacity is indicated under P.1 in cm³. The nominal power in kW is given under P.2.

**With a cubic capacity over 125 cm³**, the yearly tax is **1.84 €** per begun 25 cm³ cubic capacity. This is the calculation of the tax: Cubic capacity in cm³ : 25 x 1,84 = yearly motorcycle tax

**Examples of common tax rates:**

| Cubic capacity in cm³ | Tax per year |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| 200 cm³               | **14.72 €**  |
| 500 cm³               | **36.80 €**  |
| 650 cm³               | **47.84 €**  |
| 1000 cm³              | **73.60 €**  |
| 1300 cm³              | **95.68 €**  |

## Tax-free motorcycles

Light motorcycles (motorcycles with a maximum cubic capacity of 125 cm³) and mopeds which, due to their design, have a maximum speed of 45 km/h are tax-free. With exactly 125cm³ of cubic capacity, the nominal power is used for the decision on taxation. If this is above 11 kW, a tax of **9.20 €** is due. Tax-free motorcycles still have to be registered and insured with the regulatory authority.

## Seasonal license plates

The seasonal license plate saves taxes and insurance premiums. A seasonal license plate can basically be chosen between one and 11 full months, but the six months from April to September have become relatively firmly established among motorcyclists. The tax is calculated by dividing the annual tax rate by 12 and multiplying the result by the number of months allowed. A machine with a 650 cc displacement would cost **47,84 €** in taxes for the entire year, i.e. **3.99 €** per month. For six months, **23.92 €** would be due, for nine months it would be **35.89 €**.

## Oldtimer license plate

For the registration as an [oldtimer with H-license plate](http://localhost:50015/en/oldtimer-tax-germany/) the first registration must be 30 years ago, the vehicle must also be in its original condition, any attachments must be in accordance with the time customary. Only then does the motorcycle receive the status of a motoring cultural asset, i.e. a recognized classic car. Then the motorcycle costs **46.02 €** tax per year uniformly (independent of the cubic capacity). The status is checked anew at every general inspection.
