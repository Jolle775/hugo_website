## German Electric Car Tax 2020

One of the advantages of electric cars is the very favorable tax rate, or tax exemption for 10 years for first-time registered electric vehicles. You can find out quickly and easily how high the motor vehicle tax for your electric vehicle is with our tax calculator for electric vehicles. Simply enter the total permitted mass of your electric car in kilograms and select the registration period. You can easily find the permissible total mass in the registration certificate part I (Zulassungsbescheinigung Teil I) in field F.2. The electric car tax is calculated according to the date of first registration. It is relatively low overall, and owners are also granted an initial tax exemption. This is how the German government promotes electric mobility.

## How long do electric cars remain tax-free?

The period of initial total tax exemption depends on the date of initial registration. The tax exemption applies:

- in the case of an initial approval until 17.05.2011 for five years
- in the case of an initial approval from 18.05.2011 to 31.12.2020 for ten years

Anyone who retrofits a car to become an electric vehicle from May 2016 will also receive the ten-year tax exemption. The date of the first registration of such vehicles is irrelevant.

## How are hybrid vehicles taxed?

Hybrid technology, of which there are many variants, is regarded as highly efficient and climate friendly. Nevertheless, German legislators do not recognize the environmental benefits of hybrids in terms of taxation, or do not recognize them separately. The vehicles are taxed like any other car with an internal combustion engine, but they do benefit from their very low pollutant emissions, which are also taken into account for tax purposes.

## Calculate electric car tax

With electric cars, weight plays a role in taxation. After the tax-free phase, the tax rate per 200 kg or part thereof is depending on the permissible total weight:

- up to 2.000 kg: **5.625 €**
- 2.001 to 3.000 kg: **6.01 €**
- 3.001 to 3.500 kg: **6.30 €**

**Sample calculation of the electric car tax for a vehicle weighing 2,500 kg**

- 2.500 : 200 = 12,5 (~13)
- 13 x 6,01 = **78.13 €**

The legislator permits a rounding off to **78 €**.
